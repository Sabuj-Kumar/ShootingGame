            "7) I had a great chemistry teacher who would open his lectures up with stories and history around what we were going to learn in chemistry! It made me so excited to then learn all of the formulas etc. I was doing something that others before me had to figure out and apply to the real world. I had a math teacher who did the same. These are two subjects we don’t usually think of as an opportunity for that. If you take out time from the lesson to give it historical context (I do this with my music students all the time) you will have the most passionate and interested students. They’ll never forget what they learned !\n",

            "11) I have seen roll play scenarios in computer based training. Some of it is truly cringeworthy. In interactions with fraud, body language can play a large part. A bit of proper exaggeration may be good in initial training. However as you advance and need to spot more subtle body language, you need much better actors to model that. It really is a combination of how well the material is done and how much the student desires to know it.\n",

            "\n",
            "24) The lecture is only a small part of learning! E-learning in any form is also only a small part of learning! The REAL learning happens in the head of the student/pupil only when the student/pupil WANTS to learn and works to learn. This happens outside of the classroom at home where the student/pupil reads the coursebooks and looks up information not found in the coursebooks and makes note in writing by hand! Writing by longhand has been proven by brain research to be more effective for the retention of what has been written than writing by tapping at the keys of a computer.  And thinks about what he/she has read! The lecture is only a support and an opportunity to discuss the topic with the lecturer and ask clarifying questions about something found in the books. \n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "28) The whole problem about elearning is that it's virtual and it lacks interaction with people, which we all are used to, for summarizing.\n",
            "\n",
            "29) When i was at a normal school, I get good grades now look at this. I get 0 on some works even though I did the work.\n",
            "\n",
            "30) When internet classes started it began the beginning of killing educational tradition\n",
            "\n",
            "31) Some good points. Hence, I really have not finished an online course ever unless it is highly experiential.\n",
            "\n",
            "32) Learning style and content just like public speaking style and content needs to be delivered with the audience in mind. Also, focus on residual knowledge not just quantity knowledge. Exercises, projects, time for self-reflection about the material are very important also for learning.\n",
            "\n",
            "33) Some Teachers and lecturers don't do entry behaviour,  don't relate the purpose of what is being taught to how relevant it is and or its implementation..\n",
            "\n",
            "34) I am going to say this was with most respect, the story telling is done by the Chinese to effect human ethics on education and it's better than e-education\n",
            "\n",
            "35) I work an 8-5 shift remotely while obtaining my masters in Data Science online. I actually like having the opportunity to work remotely and learn online. The benefits to me is that I do not have to physically be in a classroom and can move around. If I want to travel to a beautiful city while working and studying I can do so. To me this has been very beneficial and I have saved tons of money (commuting, clothes, food at work) that I was able to reinvest in the stock market.\n",
            "\n",
            "36) I'm an e-Learning developer and my approach to it is to tell a story. The problem I find resides with the clients that just want to pour their PowerPoint contents into a e-Learning format and don't care if there's a better way to do it. Things are changing though, some are listening to what we advise.\n",
            "\n",
            "37) The real problem is the modern college system hasn’t caught up with the times. They keep raising prices and curtailing flexibility to meet the teacher’s needs when they want to teach not when the students want to learn. At the end of the day people want cheaper prices and flexibility.\n",
            "\n",
            "38) In fact, if the teachers are giving full commitment, the student are enthusiast to learn, and the management system of the school is excellent, the school can be the place where we can develop our skills and abilities. Not e-learning 🤔\n",
            "\n",
            "39) It all starts with the “modern“ school 😕\n",
            "\n",
            "40) E-learning is the future of education and needs to be. It’s the only way to achieve productivity gains so teachers can make reasonable salaries. Of course this implies that the subject matter is appropriate (math and science work well...) and that the instruction is well designed (different learning types and cultures are handled...). And once the bulk of academic courses are converted we can (finally!) begin to focus on the all important soft skills in the classroom.\n",
            "\n",
            "41) There are some things that are learned much Better online\n",
            "\n",
            "42) So it is true that Academia in Canada is filled with SJWs. Really misleading title and topic. The problem has nothing to do with e-learning and he undervalued its results. The problem is an educators inability of telling stories but also bad teaching in general perpetuated by bureaucracy, underfunding, and overlapping non-related issues in the world with actual issues causing problems.\n",
            "\n",
            "43) E- \"LEARNING\" DOES NOT EXIST!\r\n",
            "Dear sir, learning is always a local, psychic process, which takes place in person and cannot take place at a distance. Distance learning can be held, so the real term is E-TEACHING.\n",
            "\n",
            "44) I agree with the reference to elearning being able to educate people to sustain the planet and avoid climate change. I'm a Digital Learning Manager and I'm about to design a MOOC on this very topic. A Massively Open Online Course specifically address some of the issues around planetary and environmental consciousness. This is a good talk although I don't agree obviously. I've seen plenty of online/digital learning which is really engaging, innovative and including lots of great interactive media.\n",
            "\n",
            "45) School and class room teaching has a lot of constraints. It is produced live with very little reality surrounding them to teach practical stuff.  A video liberates the teacher. They can bring actual circumstances and contexts. Time and distance can be shrunk. \r\n",
            "Long ago I was evaluating various e-learning platforms. One was on welding. It talked of 10 methods. Illustrations used were from text books. At least half the methods were uncommon and most people may not have seen. These were also taught with illustrations from the book and narrative. I felt these should be like documentaries. They should have gone to real environments where such welding is done and shot the process with the actual equipment and let the operators to explain what the process is about. I fully appreciate your criticism of chalk and board style teaching on line.\n",
            "\n",
            "46) online class is better what about those are cheating and have poor connectivity\n",
            "\n",
            "47) Online education is far better than offline education.Online edu is affordable price.Not waste of time and money in traveling \n",
            "\n",
            "48) The problem with online education, at least in Costa Rica, is that not all the people have access to a decent internet connection, not because it is not available but because some families don´t have money to pay for it. This is creating a big gap between social classes, where families with a better economical situation are continuing with a virtual learning process, but on the other side, some families are struggling to survive one day at a time, specially now with all the COVID 19 issues, this is seriously affecting the education process in many countries in our region, if we are moving forward to this new online education era, the governments need to invest first on decent and affordable  connectivity services first to look for some equity among the population.\n",
            "\n",
            "49) E learning is nt effective atleast runing our beautiful and bright future\n",
            "\n",
            "50) I believe all he is really talking about is an online learning system that \"accommodates\" to the student. Those are already rolling. They are far from perfect, but they exist.\n",
            "\n",
            "51) Infact online education is cheaper and stronger than offline education.  Yes, it cannot replace offline education.  Still, during these times, Government must make online education free and compulsory for all students.\n",
            "\n",
            "52)  Since 21feb, when first case of codiv-19 happened in my little town of Codogno, I attended to these online courses and they helped me very much to manage work, my families and give good suggestion to my friend. Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove is one of the few scientists able to translate complex topics into simple and full \runderstandable ones.  It is even rarer to meet these high skills and abilities in such a graceful lady, with a clear and pleasant voice like the rustle of leaves in spring and at the same time a strong, confident, sweet but decisive look..\n",
            "\n",
            "53) We are unable to see our own parents and family because of this pandemic. When we can get the vaccine to fight this pandemic. How long we can stay at home. It's almost six months but  only trainings 😥😥😥. We need medicine to save our brothers and sisters all over the world.\n",
            "\n",
            "54) As a medical professional of 35 years I will never ever never take a course from The WHO!\n",
            "\n",
            "55) I teach in a rural district and many of our families do not have internet. General education teachers are recording videos on flash drives which will be dropped off by the school bus to our families who don't have internet. The students who do have internet will download the videos from our website. Do you have any suggestions how a special education teacher can help students without internet who can only receive help through pre-recorded videos?\n",
            "\n",
            "56) \"Five years from now, we'll be beyond the medical crisis, beyond the economic crisis.\" That seems very optimistic. The economic crisis caused by reactions to the cv might become another Great Depression. It could even lead to world war. It could lead to a new monetary system with much more authoritarian control over the lives of us common folk that could even become similar to a futuristic form of global technocratic slavery. Look at what the power brokers at the World Economic Forum are pushing with their \"The Great Reset\" idea.\n",
            "\n",
            "57) I work with adults in the evening and teenagers during the day, and the gap is huge. Most of the adult learners didn't even know what Zoom was, but are engaged throughout the lesson even after an entire day working. Some teens however, and it's not just one or two, are not even trying... The more devices they have at home, the less engaged with learning they are. I'm not worried about losing a school year or two. That's nothing compared to the fact that they don't understand the importance of learning. No matter how much time I put into creating engaging resources, some kids just don't care and the gap becomes bigger and bigger. What will happen to those kids? Will we go back in time? I must confess that I fear the impact of remote learning as much as I admire its potential!\n",
            "\n",
            "58) Okay i hope that next year that remote learning ends\n",
            "\n",
            "59) Yes.  For  digital education only we require only  50 % current infra . Ofcourse for certain core courses we require  labs and campus facilities  and again  the cost of university education will reduce to 50 % since students do not use any infra ..  lets embrace new way of education\n",
            "\n",
            "60) It’s 2021! The fact that there are so many American children who don’t have computers at home is crazy! Technology and access to the internet are essential. Even when schools are open, children should have the ability to learn and find resources that are available for free on the internet such as Khan Academy and edX.\n",
            "\n",
            "61) Very Impressive. I think, if online learning on going as representation of post-humanism there education will end.\n",
            "\n",
            "62) So a pandemic is what it takes for families to go on line schools , and children already online have more problems with teachers , counselor.  not up dating material fast enough for the handful right now ......good luck ..... no children in schools no teachers to pay the is the district way\n",
            "\n",
            "63) Well... I will say that having children to stay at home and learn has helped to increase parental involvement in their child's education! It has also helped to reduce the amount of disruptions that interfere with student learning in the classroom setting.I actually have some students who are doing their class work now that they are home!!  It is not up to the schools to babysit and parent  your child...  In fact, I would make more money babysitting instead of teaching!!!!\n",
            "\n",
            "64) Ah... I remember when I used to make good grades\n",
            "\n",
            "65) Before online school: Good student, As and Bs Online School: Fs and Ds, stress, and absolutely no motivation\n",
            "\n",
            "66) The teachers looking at these comments like “hmmm seems like more homework would fix the issue”\n",
            "\n",
            "67) In my opinion they should stop all schooling until it is safe for us to go back in person\n",
            "\n",
            "68) This is so trueeee. Literally my whole life and im not exaggerating I got straight A's for 10 years straight in a row FOR EACH QUARTER I HAD ALL A'S MY WHOLE LIFE. As soon as online school started, I started getting A,B, D, and F's and they threatened to take me out advance classes if i continue to get an F. Online school IS NOT IT! I constantly get GROUNDED ever since online school started because of my grades. I think it also has to due with me being in a toxic environment\n",
            "\n",
            "69) I’m going to say it, schooling should really be paused until it’s safe for in-person learning for those who actually benefit more from it than just staring at a computer screen which can also do some eye damage since it’s all we ever work on for remote classes.\n",
            "\n",
            "70) I've learned more just reading these comments than actually in online school.\n",
            "\n",
            "71) Man i am going through it. \r\n",
            "I never was a perfect student, \r\n",

            "74) it's funny cause i didn't lose any intelligence, in fact in quarantine i have gained a lot of knowledge, from studying and learning things on my own. The Fs don't mean i'm less smart, it's a good representation of online school failing us.\n",
            "\n",
            "75) I’m great at cheating, so I’m passing all my classes with ease, but once I get back to school, I’m failing my math class for sure lol\n",
            "\n",
            "76) I just noticed online school only happened because of corona. I could’ve had good grades in irl school if it wasn’t for corona.\r\n",
            "\n",
            "77) Got my first F ever in college this semester. I'm having a hard time accepting it mentally, but what can I do. A little sensitivity from my uni would be appreciated. Instead they chose to invest so much money into technologies that watch us take exams in our own private homes. We don't have access to so many resources we usually have on campus, yet they expect us to maintain \"integrity\" and not use notes. Not fair\r\n",
            "\n",
            "78) It’s just the motivation just ain’t there to do anything, especially since I don’t have zoom classes, so it’s more of just having a ton of home work all in one day instead of an actual class.\r\n",
            "\n",
            "79) When I was in grade school, I always had this mentality that I need to have exceptional grades in order to be successful in life. However, my academic performance said otherwise; I ended up flunking 8th grade and graduated high school in 2013 with barely a 2.0 GPA. (no AP classes taken). And obviously, I didn't go to college.....well not right away, and it wasn't a top-ranked school\n",
            "\n",
            "80) I'm glad to know that I am not the only one stressed out too. But I would have been better if I was in school than in a virtual school. I now have 37 missing assignments and it's hard to keep up with them. I can't take it anymore doing virtual school my eyes just hurt by looking at the screen for 8 hours straight. Especially when the teachers have light mode on.\n",
            "\n",
            "81) Couldn't school just stop until the pandemic is over then continue? That could've been easier. I understand why teachers want us to turn on the camera but I don't feel comfortable looking at my own face or showing my face. \n",

            "\n",
            "85) I knew I was gonna fail this year. Virtual has made me lose all motivation to do anything. I'm depressed and stressed out. And all my parents can say are \"This is easy work your suppose to be smart\". I can't anymore I'm just glad it's over\r\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "\n",
            "87) I literally used to be a student who would finish homework before school even ended\n",

I have a chance of getting kicked out my program by the end of the year if I don’t get my grades up. It’s only the second quarter, but I’m afraid I’m not going to be able to get good grades throughout the year and would have to stay back. My mom is like I just need to focus, but I CANT I get so distracted so easily and have no motivation to even do an assignment. One week I would be so motivated then the next I would just space out in all of my zoom classes. I failed like 3 classes out of 8 last quarter, but right now I’m failing more than that. I don’t know what to do I don’t want to talk to my mom or any counselor because that’s not going to help me at all.\r\n",
            "\n",
            "89) They expect way too much out of us in online school what may last over a month to teach in normal school they expect you to learn within a days (or 2) time so if you mess up twice you have to completely restart and taking notes is even harder due to having to do 7 different classes and with how long each lesson takes you don't get enough time to take all the notes needed unless that's all you wanna do for most of the day and don't even get me started on how much stress it induces at one point I was starting to taste a metallic coppery flavor in my mouth and my heart felt like it was on fire due to how stressful it all was and I'm going to have to repeat the grade all because my computer broke and the school isn't willing to supply one so I'm screwed and it's all because they couldn't wait a single year for all that's going on to calm down\r\n",
            "\n",
            "90) I used to be such a good student but now I'm failing all my classes except one, I'm not motivated and I try to pay attention but I just can't understand what my teachers are trying to teach us but when I just do it by myself with no teachers I understand almost everything, TikTok literally helped me and I understood freaking high school stuff with the TikTok tutors and I'm in middle school... I got so much anxiety to the point I can't breathe especially when my school calls, About the not understanding what my teachers are telling us has always been like that though... I just told my parents this year cause I was having a harder time but they got mad at me 😅\r\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "92) I went out of freshman year with more As than Bs, now in sophomore year I’m sitting on two Fs, Cs and Ds, and a few As. The end of the semester feels like the end of the year because I want it to end just for a few weeks\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "93) Very Impressive. I think, if online learning on going as representation of post-humanism there education will end.\n",
            "\n",
            "94) I’m pretty sure the majority has failed because we aren’t used to learning from home rather than school to get that same experience with our friends and teachers around to help\n",
            "\n",
            "95) when I got stressed out over not being able to adapt to the situation of how online school was not meant for me, I practically gave up because I didn’t wanna stress myself out more\n",
            "\n",

            "97) I’ve been a straight A student my entire school career, I’ve been failing so many tests in Virtual learning\r\n",

            "98) Im from cali and before all this i had a 2.6 gpa pretty average grades life was good now I have a 0.5 gpa im in 9th grade and was excited for highschool but not anymore now I want to start a new life not suffer through all this bullshit.\r\n",
            "\n",
            "99) Seems like I'm not the only one who used to be a good student and now I'm literally failing\r\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "100) I can't believe they still want us too take big test's like the STARR test to pass the school year. They should really be more understanding and empathetic to us because we are struggling as well and they need to just let us pass and to give us break until everything goes back to normal\r\n",
            "\n",
            "101) I don't know why my teachers are giving us more work during quarantine then they used too. And the apps we have to use don't explain or show us lessons good at all.\r\n",
            "\n",
            "102) I tried reaching out to my counselor before because I was struggling, and they looked at my grades and told me that I was being too hard on myself. I’m currently failing all of my classes. I emailed my teachers to ask for an action plan, and my anxiety’s going through the roof, but I’m trying! I’m trying!!!!!\r\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "104) I actually began to cry when I realized that I probably failed my previous two classes. I felt a lot of stress about it; I began to wonder if my job was at fault because I'm an essential worker from a grocery store. No matter how I tried to keep up, I couldn't really focus at home. When I found this video, it all clicked that I actually did well before the pandemic happened because I used to be able to walk into my campus library to read my required papers to study and complete homework assignments more independently. It was so easy to go to campus to relax in the library. My mom may have initially reacted disappointed at first, but I also realized that she doesn't necessarily remember the reality of being able to learn from failure. I learned a lot from the previous fall semester, so I already know what to do next.\r\n",
            "\n",
            "105) At this rate they should just let the people who actually try to let them pass this year cause they overwhelmed us with to much work when a pandemic is going on\r\n",
            "\n",
            "106) They should do packets every two weeks they get new packets and go to school and hand it  in. While useing mask and social Distance\r\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "108) It could be a lack of interaction and proactive with less help from the school resource. Hell, I went to the same problem when I go to school, and they told me. Do the best as you can?? They haven't gave me much source to help me even as a special needs student. I'm drowning and depressed back then. It still haunts me.🥺 Anyways, poor kids.\r\n",
            "\n",
            "109) my final grade is next week and i have 30 percents in all classes, im a freshman and i want to cry right now.\r\n",
            "\n",
            "110) I used to make good grades, and I thought that it would be easier this way. But instead my school is giving 2x more work than before, and I was like \"wtf don't give us more work just because we're in our home\". Also the lessons are so damn rushed, i only like learning and doing new things slowly.\r\n",
            "\n",
            "111) First month of lockdown felt heavenly but now I’m getting more and more depressed and this school thing is giving me anxiety about my future, already I was getting majority C’s and some B and A’s before COVID but not I’m getting like 3  F’s, 2 G’s, 1 A and 1 B. I have adhd and I have no access to stimulant.. and teachers never help even though when I joined the school we gave the report of my disabilities :(\r\n",

            "113) Over 7000 students without laptops. Even more with out wifi. Why was education cut before covid-19  again by Texas government. Every year it is defunded. Now those funds are especially needed and kids are the ones not being kept safe. We lost 5 family members to covid. 1 more just got over his infection. We made home schooling work. Texas is a red state no excuse ever for failure.\r\n",

            "\n",

Now I have to go back to school next week and risk getting covid because I’m failing at online classes, on top of that my dad has to wake up early to drop me off to school and pick me up. I guess it’s good in a way because at least I can concentrate more but why can’t they just let us relax until the pandemic ends?\r\n",

HARD. i think im failing most of my classes right now. My mental health is seriously not the best, and my parents might divorce very soon. Theres constant fights and problems at home and i cant even support myself, I try to distract myself to feel calm but in result of that distracting it causes me to miss more work and more zooms, and each time i do make up some missing works they IMMEDIATELY come RIGHT back and even more than before, I swear ever since online class they are literally just adding more and more work then they even did in normal school. And it doesnt help that i have depression. i dont know what to do. ive already lost all my motivation and day by day the work just stacks up. i dont even care anymore. im just glad im not the only one from looking through this comment section.\n",

They say that they're trying to help me but if I even say \"but it isn't\" or say \"how is it helping me\" my parents get even madder and yell at me. I feel like they don't even care about my mental health. Other students keep saying, \"oh is super easy\" or \"school is easy as pie\".

Chatting with friends, getting to know the teachers, sports events, etc. Now with online, there is none of that.

It is not the right environment because home is usually a place to unwind and relax AFTER school. We miss out on tons of things and at this point, I don't even feel like a student anymore.

Expecting us to do them in unreasonable timeframes. Plus, majority of us stopped being kids when we had to join the work field to support our families. But ofc.. they don't care.

We are all dealing with more trouble. The reason why we are doing worse is because we are dealing with a literal pandemic and having a lot of stress. We are also more demotivated to do work at home. But let’s try to get through this, we can do it! Just remember that grades do not define your intelligence, and mental health is more important. School is being forced onto us, but we can get through it. Things were not good, but now they are worse during the pandemic. In school, we have to memorize a bunch of random information. Our intelligence is not measured by how much information we can take in, it is measured by how much we truly know and can do. For example, we can have creative intelligence, which is about our ability to get creative and be smart in different ways, such as thinking about solutions to certain issues. Things may be rough, but I believe we can get through this. We’re in this together! 😁\r\n",

Virtual Online Classes they give more assignments and more homework that they give than physically going to school. They need to decrease the work. The second issue is that there are too many students. And when you ask a question you probably can't ask again because the teacher has to move on her or his lesson. That's the problem, student's can't just learn like that. They don't have the same brain. Every student is different. Tutoring is a waste of time as well. The only option is having atleast 8 or 9 kids with one teacher. That is more better comparing 30 students with 1 teacher. I as a student who goes with atleast 24 students and even more, I don't even learn from the teachers I learned by memorizing and reviewing. The teachers aren't even teaching.

We did more hands on learning and she helped me at my job in an art studio. She was happy and stress free. However the consequences was she got poor grades because she didn't participate. I felt guilty at first. However as and early childhood educator and educational assistant I have an education in childhood brain development. I know deep inside I made the right choice for us.

            "291) I am an elementary public school teacher.  I don't want to put my family at risk of Covid.  I hate online classes, as well.  I can tell that I am losing the students.  I have tried many ways to keep them engaged, but it just isn't working.  Some students are doing well, but I would say that the majority are failing.  I only assign 1 reading and 1 math assignment, daily.  I thought this was easily doable for my students.  I make sure the assignment correlates with the daily online lesson that I taught.  I give time for students to complete the assignment in class, so they can ask questions, or so I can monitor where the misconceptions are.  However, all of these efforts seem to be for naught.  I have stated several times, since the very beginning, that we should all \"delete\" this school year and redo it.  It is not a popular suggestion, but these kids are having such issues with it, that I believe it is just adding to the already stressed out family.  If we re-do, students get another year to get better grades, because they will get to review all the topics taught.  Success can still happen this way.  Otherwise, the students will not be prepared for the following school year.  They will start out behind in all areas.  I know High school seniors might be an exception to this rule, and they have most of what they need to succeed in the real world, anyway.  The standardized testing to enter college should be waived, this year.  This should not stop seniors from getting into colleges or careers!\r\n",

At home learning still centers itself around a classroom environment whereas homeschooling is focused on self paced, on your own learning. The problem here is that there isn't any material (workbooks/textbooks) to send home with the children. They are basically watching a lecture online and doing online assignments. The material wasn't designed for online use. It's just being adapted to it. Traditional homeschooling would have content created for home use. I don't think judging the way things are going currently gives an indication of what true homeschooling is like because it only adapts current curriculum to at home. In order to be effective, it would need to be designed for at home use. Only then would I call it homeschooling.\r\n",

But  the majority of Americans dont care because they not only do not value education they sneer at it. This is why so much of the current response to the epidemic is sorcery and not at all proven via scientific studies ( indiscriminate use of masks, social distancing, staying at home, closing the economy, etc) For the masses and politicians its all about incredibly self-confident declarations based on facts by mere bombastic Hitlerian assertions!

That’ s all redundant to a point that we have siblings, mental issues, other classes, trouble with availability to the internet, and other issues that many have turned a blind eye to. It’s not easy sending an email to teachers, it’s not easy when we are expected to maintain academic integrity with many distractions at home, it’s not easy to have ‘good’ grades when the weighted score is unreasonable for when one missing assignment is worth a letter drop.

The overflow of assignments, the strict due dates, the seemingly unforgiving teachers who don't understand we have lives outside of school, it's too much.

ALL the kids that were failing my online class last spring wouldn't do HALF the assignments if ANY at all. To be honest the assignments I gave were NOT difficult or even time consuming bc i dont believe education has to be complicated or busy work to be effective. The assignments given were simple things that were easier then when I was in high-school like, read a chapter, take a quiz, watch a 10min video. So many wouldn't even do that. It is unethical to pass a student that wont even bother doing work. It just so happened that it was the same students that failed to do any work during the shutdown were the same ones that didnt do homework or spent the majority of the time in class not doing their work during the semester BEFORE covid. These students are the ones that make teaching feel more like babysitting and hold the learning back for everyone else bc we have to cater to their lack of responsibilities. Parents if you feel like it is difficult with one or however many children you have to get them to work try doing that with 90 students at a time. In any given class i taught half wouldn't do their work on time. I had 6 classes w around 30 students per. Sometimes i had to waste half the class period just calling students down individually to ask them where their work is or to talk to them about their failing grades so that we can fix it. Try calling that many parents or writing that many emails each week. At 5min a call that is an extra 7.5h of work on a teacher that they dont get paid for, not to mention the tutorials just to get those kids passing. The issue we are facing isnt one of reforming schools but reforming how we raise children to be more responsible. We have a bunch of lazy, entitled kids today. Dont get me wrong, i loved all my students, even the difficult ones but sometimes i felt like i had to be the parent and teach my students to take pride in being independent and successful. \r\n",

Now we still have major gaps in our poorer areas, as this pandemic has shown. Several schools have resorted to printing out lessons, which are delivered weekly to a neighborhood center along with school meals. Wifi is only available when the center is open, 2-4 hrs 3 days a week. Very few elementary students have access to any electronic device other than a parent's phone. How can we change this when all states are going to have to cut budgets sharply this yr? Must we continue to have such a sharp division in the availability of education? This is an issue that distance learning was designed to correct, or at least that is what I understood when I became involved with it. Is there a financially viable answer?\n",

My kid got the short end of the straw in the beginning she only had school on Mondays and Wednesday’s the other 3 week days she was given at home assignments no online or zoom learning. So behavior wise she would just go to “get it over with not to learn” because after Wednesday she’s off for the other 3 school days and the weekend.. off 5 days before she goes back to school on Mondays.

God i hate my self so much, im ugly, stupid, and one of the worst sons someone could ask for, and i know it too. My mom made up all these lies about my dad to drive him out of my life. on my dads side, we were all best friends, we all loved eachother, watching movies, going to the pool. on my moms side everyone hates eachother, my grandpa hates me, my grandma hates me, my mom hates me, my brother hates me, I hate me. i dont know what to do.\r\n",

Honestly, it's so hard to find any motivation to finish work on time, and when I don't I just get even more stressed trying to finish it all at the last minute, so now I'm stuck with an F in one of my classes and I'm just scared of what my parents are going to say if they ever see my grades, my parents get angry if I have B's so I don't even wanna think about what they will say when they see I have C's D's and an F when I used to get A's and B's. I don't even know what I'm gonna do about my grades (if I can even do anything) and I just want it all to end.

In online school I feel like there's less work but its harder to do because you spend like an hour on a worthless zoom meeting where it could be summed up in ten minutes and after wasting time they go \"here's the assignment\" without giving us time in class.

I have another cousin who feels they are truly learning in health class because that teacher can teach while he ended up with mostly teachers that were bad already pre-Covid.

I work with each of my children individually every single day and they are still struggling with the work because they didn't have the opportunity to finish out the last school year and instead of going over the things they missed, the teachers just started out like any other school year.  We have to remember as adults that these kids are going through something that we never experienced, they are isolated in the home and have little to no interaction with their friends and sometimes family.  Another important part of school they are missing out on is social interaction, it's very important for children to learn how to interact with their peers.
